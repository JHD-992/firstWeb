        Elephants are the largest land mammal. The tallest can measure up to 3.3 meters at the shoulder and weigh up to 7 tons. They have
        large ears which help them to regulate their body temperature. They are very sociable animals and live in groups with the exception being
        large older bulls which are sometimes solitary. 
        <br>
        <br>
        They can live to be around 70 years of age and there is a strong link between the condition
        of their teeth and how old they can get. Their trunks are made up of hundreds of muscles have many uses. They use their trunks as a snorkel,
        to pick things up and suck up, up to 8 litres of water.

        Lions are sexually dimorphic which means that males and females look noticeably different. Males are larger and can be up to two meters
        long where as females reach 1.8 meters at most. Males also have a large main that makes them look even larger and offers protection in
        territorial fights. They are the second largest of the big cats and the only big cats that live in social groups with females living
        in prides. Males may form coalitions with other males or spend their lives as solitary individuals. Recent research shows that males home
        ranges may overlap with the home range of multiple female prides.
        <br>
        <br>
        While the average lifespan of lions in the harder natural environment is around 10 years they have been known to reach 22 years of age in
        captivity. The reason for the decreased life expectancy in the wild is down to the injuries etc that can result from territorial battles
        and hunting. In very rare cases animals with white coats are born.

      <p id="RhinoInfo" class="animalInfoLeft">
        White rhinos, more accurately described as the square-lipped rhino, is considered to be the second largest land mammal after the elephant.
        They can be up to 4 meters in length and up to 186cm at the shoulder. They can weigh up to 2.3 tons although records exist of individuals up
        to 3.6 tons. They have large heads with characteristic wide, square lips. They have three toes on each foot and are predominantly grazers; they
        eat mostly grass. They can live in groups of up to 14 animals although males are usually solitary. They can live to be up to 50 years old.
        <br>
        <br>
        Black rhinos, also known as hook-lipped rhinos, are smaller than their wide-lipped cousins. They reach 180cm at the shoulder and can be up to 3.75 meters
        long. They commonly weigh up to 1.5 tons although reports exist of unusually large males reaching 2.9 tons. The pointed lip is very dexturous and is used
        to help when feeding. As opposed to white rhinos, black rhinos are mostly solitary by nature. They can also reach up to 50 years of age.

        Males can weigh between 60 and 96kgs while females have an average maximum weight of around 40kgs. They are strongly territorial and live a
        solitary lifestyle. They are very adept climbers and will often rest in trees. They also hoist their kills into the trees in efforts to protect
        their meals from other animals. They are considered to be extremely strong for their relatively small size due to the ability to pull their large
        prey animals into trees.
      <br>
      <br>
        The average life expectancy of the leopard in the wild is 12 to 15 years and up to 23 years in captivity.

        They can reach up to 1.7m at the shoulder adn be up to 3.4 meters long. Large individuals regularly reach 1 ton in weight. They are well
        known as dangerous animals due to their unpredicatble natures and are responisble for many human deaths every year. They are highly social
        animals and congregate in herds. Some heards remain relatively small while others number in the hundreds.
      <br>
      <br>
        They can be very aggresive animals when put under pressure while also being extremly protective of their herd members. Many records
        exist of the herd defending injured members and attacking their predators.
